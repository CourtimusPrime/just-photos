# The JustPhotos Manifesto
## Social media is broken -- on purpose.
Social media did not accidentally become what it is today.

It was **designed** this way.

What began as a way to share moments with people you care about has been hollowed out and rebuilt around a single goal:

**extract as much attention as possible, for as long as possible.**

**Connection** was replaced with **engagement**.
**Chronology** was replaced with **algorithms**.
**Humanity** was replaced with **metrics**.

This wasn't an evolution.
It was a hostile takeover.

## You are the product
Modern social media platforms don't serve you content.
They **shape your behavior**.

They use:
* Infinite scrolls engineered to remove stopping points
* Algorithms optimized for outrage, envy, and fear
* Metrics that turn self-worth into performance
* Notifications calibrated to trigger anxiety
* Ads disguised as recommendations
* Feeds designed to keep you ever-slightly dissatisfied.

None of this exists to make your life better.
It exists to keep you naive, afraid, and scrolling.

Your attention is sold.
Your emotions are optimized.
Your time is harvested.

You are not the user.
You are the product.

## "Free" was a lie that ruined everything
When a product is free, **you are the product** is not a slogal -- it's an economic fact.

To sell ads, platforms must:
* Know you
* Track you
* Predict you
* Influence you

That requires surveillance.
Surveillance requires manipulation.
Manipulation destroys trust.

Social media didn't just get noisy -- it became **hostile to genuine human interaction**.

## Metrics poisoned connection
Likes, followers, streaks, views -- these are not neutral features.

They:
* Turn sharing into performance
* Replace expression with optimization
* Encourage comparison instead of connection
* Train people to post what performs, not what matters

You stop sharing moments.
You start managing the brand of **you**.

That is not social.
That is extraction.

## We reject the attention economy
JustPhotos exists because we don't believe this is inevitable.

We reject:
* Engagement-first design
* Algorithmic feeds
* Growth-at-all-costs thinking
* Behavioural manipulation
* Advertising-driven platforms

We reject the idea that connection must come with addition.

--

## What we believe instead
We believe:
* Social tools should serve humanity, not advertisers
* Small, organic, transparent products are healthier than viral ones
* Chronological feeds respect users
* Fewer features mean better outcomes
* Leaving the app should be easy and encouraged
* Paying a small fee is better than being exploited

We believe software should **get out of the way**.

## JustPhotos is intentionally limited
No videos.

No stories.

No reels.

No algorithms.

No metrics designed to pressure you.

Just photos, shared with people you choose.

Not to build an audience.

Not to chase validation.

Not to stay "engaged".

Just to share your life -- quietly.

## Transparency is not optional

You should always know:
* Why you see what you see
* Who can see your content
* How the product makes money
* What data is (and isn't) collected

If a platform can't epxlain itself simply, it doesn't deserve your trust.

## This is a small rebellion
JustPhotos is not trying to replace the internet.

It's not trying to scale endlessly.

It's not trying to win.

It's trying to prove that **another way is still possible**.

A calmer intenret.

A deliberate internet.

An internet that is better for humanity.

## If this resonates, act
Use tools that respect you.

Pay for products that don't exploit you.

Reject platforms that treat your mind like as inventory.

The internet becomes what we tolerate.

We choose not to tolerate this anymore.

**Just Photos**
Social media for people who have social media.

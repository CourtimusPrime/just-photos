## Why JustPhotos Exists

### Social media has become evil

What started as a way to stay connected has turned into something else entirely.

Big Tech broke what was great about social media and replaced it with:
- Engagement farming
- Endless feeds
- Manipulative algorithms
- Ads disguised as content

The goal is no longer connection -- it's attention.

Your time, your focus, your mind. 

**We don't want that.**

## What Makes JustPhotos Different

### No videos. No ads. No bullshit.

JustPhotos is deliberately small and boring -- by design.

- **Photos only**
  No videos. No stories. No reels. No trends.

- **Friends only**
  Your photos are visible only to people you choose. We don't sell your data or photos to anyone for any reason.

- **No metrics**
  No follower counts. No like counts. No performance anxiety. You'll only get a quiet notification when someone likes your stuff.

- **No manipulation**
  No algorithms deciding what you see.
  No infinite scroll designed to trap you.

Post photos for your friends to see.  
See photos from people you care about.  
Then leave.

## The Philosophy

JustPhotos is not trying to win your attention.

It's trying to **get out of the way**.
- No ads
- No tracking-based recommendations
- No growth hacks
- No dark patterns

If you want to post more than 50 photos, you pay a small fee.  
That’s it. You are the customer — not the product.

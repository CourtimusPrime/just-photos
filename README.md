# JustPhotos

## Social media is broken -- on purpose.

JustPhotos rejects the attention economy. No algorithms. No metrics. No ads. Just photos, shared chronologically with people you choose.

This is a small rebellion against platforms that harvest your attention and exploit your emotions.

## What is JustPhotos?

A Bun-first Turborepo monorepo delivering a simple photo-sharing experience:

- **Backend**: Next.js (App Router) for API and server-side rendering
- **Frontend**: React + Vite for the client-side experience
- **Shared Code**: TypeScript utilities and UI components in packages

We believe software should get out of the way. JustPhotos is intentionally limited: photos only, chronological feeds, transparency first.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Bun (not npm, yarn, or pnpm)

### Installation
```bash
bun install
```

### Development
```bash
bun run dev
```

This spins up both the backend and frontend via Turborepo.

### Build
```bash
bun run build
```

### Linting
```bash
bun run lint
```
